Write program so that it calculates and displays:
+ dialogue with user for obtaining value of a
+ dialogue with user for obtaining value of b
+ dialogue with user for obtaining value of c
+ dialogue with user for obtaining value of precision
- calculated value of x for equation f(x)=c for x between a and b
- calculated value of f(x) for this x
- number of iterations used to find this value of x

- upload to github figure of function with pointed f(x)=c solution point // use gnuplot
